## Instructions for Editing

1. **Review each category** - Do the subcategories make sense for your marketplace?
2. **Edit the lists** - Add, remove, or rename subcategories as needed
3. **Keep it consistent** - Try to maintain similar number of subcategories per category (3-6 recommended)
4. **Think about your sellers** - What will they actually be selling?
5. **Consider discoverability** - Will buyers easily find what they're looking for?

## Format Guidelines

When editing, please maintain this format:
```
Category Name:
- Subcategory 1
- Subcategory 2
- Subcategory 3
```

Or simply reply with your edited list and I'll implement it!

**Once you've finalized the subcategories, I'll:**

2. Generate the complete seed.ts code
3. Implement the changes on the CATEGORIES branch
